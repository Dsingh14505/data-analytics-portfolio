## Problem Statement
Analyze Titanic passenger data to identify key factors influencing survival
and convert insights into actionable business recommendations.

---

## Project Overview
**Complete End-to-End Data Analysis of Titanic Passenger Data**

### What I Built
- Cleaned messy dataset (177 missing Age values + Embarked)
- Engineered new features (FamilySize, IsAlone, AgeGroup categories)
- Created professional 6-panel EDA dashboard
- Built correlation heatmap analysis
- Delivered actionable business insights

---

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset
- Total Records: 891 passengers
- Features: 12 columns

---

## Key Business Findings
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Female Survival Rate** | **74.2%** |
| **1st Class Survival** | **62.9%** |
| **Alone Passengers Correlation** | **-0.20** |

## Visualizations Created
1. **6-Panel Dashboard** - Survival patterns by Gender, Class, Age, and Embarkation
2. **Correlation Heatmap** - Feature relationships using Seaborn
3. **Survival Pie Chart** - Gender distribution among survivors
